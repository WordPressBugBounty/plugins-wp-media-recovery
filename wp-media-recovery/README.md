[**Media Library Recovery**](https://mediarecoveryplugin.com/?utm_source=mlr&utm_medium=free_plugin&utm_campaign=readme_md) helps restore existing image files from the uploads folder and reinsert them into the WordPress database properly.

You can recover individual image files or use the filters and navigation in the custom **Media Explorer** to streamline the process.

## USAGE

Once the plugin is uploaded and activated:

1. Navigate to **Media > Media Recovery** in the main menu to open the **Media Explorer**.
2. Use the options to show or hide existing image files already found in your server and database.

Here are the steps to use [**Media Library Recovery**](https://mediarecoveryplugin.com/?utm_source=mlr&utm_medium=free_plugin&utm_campaign=readme_md):

1. Open the **Media Explorer**.
2. Select the image files you want to recover.
3. Click the **Media Recovery...** button and wait for the images to rebuild.
4. Go to **Media > Media Recovery** to confirm the images were recovered successfully.

**Note:** The plugin **does not upload or overwrite any images on the server**. It only scans for image files in the default WordPress uploads folder.

## FEATURES & LIMITATIONS

The [**Media Library Recovery**](https://mediarecoveryplugin.com/?utm_source=mlr&utm_medium=free_plugin&utm_campaign=readme_md) plugin allows you to:

- Restore and recover images after database failure or reset if the files are still on your server.
- Quickly rebuild your Media Library with the custom **Media Explorer**.
- Hide existing image files already in the Media Library.
- Display unique icons for **existing**, **recoverable**, **selected**, and **unavailable** image files for easy recovery management.

### Known Issues and Limitations

- Original image files with dimensions in their file names (e.g., `icon-128x128.png`) won't appear in the Media Explorer.
- You can recover a maximum of **10 images** at a time.
- Image file sizes must not exceed **2MB** to avoid exceeding the `max_execution_time` on most servers.
